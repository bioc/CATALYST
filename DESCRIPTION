Description: Mass cytometry (CyTOF) uses heavy metal isotopes rather
        than fluorescent tags as reporters to label antibodies, thereby
        substantially decreasing spectral overlap and allowing for
        examination of over 50 parameters at the single cell level.
        While spectral overlap is significantly less pronounced in
        CyTOF than flow cytometry, spillover due to detection
        sensitivity, isotopic impurities, and oxide formation can
        impede data interpretability. We designed CATALYST (Cytometry
        dATa anALYSis Tools) to provide a pipeline for preprocessing of
        cytometry data, including i) normalization using bead
        standards, ii) single-cell deconvolution, and iii) bead-based
        compensation.
